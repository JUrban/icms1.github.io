# international Congress on Mathematical Software - ICMS 2018
## Notre Dame, 24-27 July 2018

**Sessions (to be proposed and completed)**

The congress is organized in sessions, addressing different aspects of mathematical
software. There will be also demos, tutorials and posters. If you would like to give a
talk, you need to submit first a short abstract and then later an extended abstract to one
of the organizers of the corresponding session.

For inspiration, have a look at the sessions of past ICMS:
[ICMS 2016](http://icms2016.zib.de/sessions.html),
[ICMS 2014](http://voronoi.hanyang.ac.kr/icms2014/index.html?PageID=Sessions_contents),
and [ICMS 2010](http://www.math.kobe-u.ac.jp/icms2010/parts/sessions.html)
