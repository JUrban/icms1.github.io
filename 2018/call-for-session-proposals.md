ICMS 2018 Call for Session Proposals
============================


The _6th International Congress on Mathematical Software_ will consist of several topical sessions. Each session will provide an overview of the challenges, achievements and progress in a subfield of mathematical software research, development and use. The program committee will consist of the session organizers. We solicit session proposals.

**You are invited to propose a session if you**

*   are active in mathematical software research, development and use,
*   want to serve the research community by nurturing and facilitating mathematical software work in your area, and
*   would like to focus only on the scientific matters in the organization (not on other matters such as administrative, logistic, etc).

**How to propose a session**

1.  Prepare a session proposal with the following contents.

    *   title of the session
    *   name(s) of the organizer(s), with contact addresses and emails
    *   aim and scope of the session (at most 150 words)

2.  Submit it

    *   to one of the program chairs: [Manuel Kauers](mailto:manuel@kauers.de) , [George Labahn](mailto:glabahn@uwaterloo.ca) or [Josef Urban](mailto:Josef.Urban@gmail.com)
    *   or to the General Chair [James Davenport](mailto:j.h.davenport@bath.ac.uk)
    *   at latest by **Jan 31, 2018**.

3.  The decision on the proposal will be made

    *   by the program chair, the general chair and the advisory committee
    *   within **mid-February 2018**

**How to organize a session**

*   Maintain a session web page (see template in [html-format](http://icms-conference.org/2018/icms_session_2018) or [markdown-format](icms_session_2018.txt)).
*   Send a call for abstracts to the potential speakers in the topic area of the session (see template in [tex-format](ICMS_Extended_Abstract_2018.tex) or in [pdf-format](ICMS_Extended_Abstract_2018.pdf)).
*   Review the submitted abstracts and make decision on their acceptance, as soon as each one arrives.
*   Complete the process by **Apr 15, 2018**.
*   During the meeting, chair the session.

**Format of a session**

*   A session will consist of one or more time slots.
*   A time slot will consist of about 3 - 4 talks.
*   We encourage that each session begins with one general overview talk (may be given by a session organizer).

This format is meant only as a rough frame; the organization of a session can be done in a quite free fashion (e.g., concerning the duration of the individual contributions). "Talks" may also include software presentations and demos.

**Possible topics for sessions**  

*   These are _not_ exclusive. You can propose any mathematical topic.
*   These are _not_ required titles of sessions. You can propose any title.
*   These are provided as initial hint for topics and titles.
